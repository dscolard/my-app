##Motor Neurone Disease
	Motor neurones are specialised nerve cells that control important voluntary muscle activity such as walking, talking and breathing. MND refers to any 
	disease which inhibits these nerve cells and prevents them from operating normally. The loss of motor neurone function leads to increasing loss of 
	mobility in the limbs and difficulty with speech, swallowing and breathing. Ultimately the prognosis is death, 70% of people with ALS (The most common 
		form of MND) die within three years after the first symptoms present themselves.

##Prediction Model
	MND is a rare disease which progresses rapidly, these factors combined have made it extremely difficult to gather patient data and carry out 
	widespread trials to fully understand the disease. Thus far there are no accredited models for predicting how fast the disease may progress in an 
	individual patient. This information is critical for risk assessment and counselling for individual patients, stratification of patients for trials, 
	and timing of interventions. Researchers here at Trinity College Dublin aim to solve this issue by developing and validating a model capable of 
	predicting the composite survival endpoint for individual patients with ALS. 

##My Contribution
	High Data Quality is a vital prerequisite for any predictive model in order to ensure accurate and useful predictions. Data Quality is measured using 
	multiple factors such as accuracy, completeness, consistency, reliability and whether it's up to date. It is my job to analyse our dataset in order to 
	monitor these conditions. The results of my analysis will be available in real time via a web application. This web application will be accessible to 
	the researchers allowing them to easily view and understand their dataset.
