## Web based data quality analysis project

For this project i will be working alongside Trinity College researchers at the forefront of motor neurone disease research. I will be building a web application to store and display the data they have gathered over the past 10 years. Along with this I will analyse the data given and produce dashboards displaying the Data Quality statistics.
