## Motor Neurone Disease
	Motor neurones are specialised nerve cells that control important voluntary muscle activity such as 
	walking, talking and breathing. MND refers to any disease which inhibits these nerve cells and prevents 
	them from operating normally. The loss of motor neurone function leads to increasing loss of mobility 
	in the limbs and difficulty with speech, swallowing and breathing. Ultimately the prognosis is death, 
	70% of people with ALS (The most common form of MND) die within three years after the first symptoms 
	present themselves.

## Prediction Model
	MND is a rare disease which progresses rapidly, these factors combined have made it extremely difficult 
	to gather patient data and carry out widespread trials to fully understand the disease. Thus far there 
	are no accredited models for predicting how fast the disease may progress in an individual patient. This 
	information is critical for risk assessment and counselling for individual patients, stratification of 
	patients for trials, and timing of interventions. Researchers here at Trinity College Dublin aim to solve 
	this issue by developing and validating a model capable of predicting the composite survival endpoint 
	for individual patients with ALS. 

## My Contribution
	High Data Quality is a vital prerequisite for any predictive model in order to ensure accurate and useful 
	predictions. Data Quality is measured using multiple factors such as accuracy, completeness, consistency, 
	reliability and whether it's up to date. It is my job to analyse our dataset in order to monitor these 
	conditions. The results of my analysis will be available in real time via a web application. This web 
	application will be accessible to the researchers allowing them to easily view and understand their dataset.
